          <p className={boldText}>
            The Bible defines our beliefs. The Spirit guides us in
            understanding.
            <br />
            <br />
            God. He is the Father, there from the beginning. Maker of the
            heavens and the earth. The earth is the Lord's, and everything in
            it. He created man, both male and female, Adam and Eve. He breathed
            life into us, setting us apart from all other created beings. He
            gave us a mind, soul, and spirit. He placed two tress in the garden
            of Eden. The tree of Life, with a fruit that made man eternal. The
            tree of the knowledge of good and evil, with a fruit that brought
            death. Forbidding man from eating from the tree of knowledge of good
            and evil. The Father knew what he was doing giving us this choice.
            We were created not just to bring Him glory, but to be His weapon to
            defeat the devil. We took His commands for granted. Eve sinned by
            listening to the devil, convinced to eat the forbidden fruit. Adam
            listened to his wife, and partook in her sin. Thus sin entered into
            the perfect creation of the Father. A fallen planet. A fallen
            people. The Father left them with a promise, her sead would crush
            the head of the devil. Man kind waited for this hope, that one day
            the solution to sin would come. One day, a savior would be born.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jesus. He is the Son, there from the beginning. He is the Christ,
            the messiah. He came to earth fully God and fully man. Born to a
            virgin. He walked amongst us. He came to save the world of sin,
            reconciling us with the Father. Healing many of their illness,
            redeeming many through the forgiveness of their sins. He died a
            criminals death on the cross in your place. Paid the ultimate price
            for your sins. By His blood, He saves you. By His stripes, He heals
            you. They placed Him in a tomb. For three days His body laid there
            as He descended into hell. Down in the depths, He took back what was
            stolen from the Father, His children. On the third day, He rose from
            the dead. The ultimate victor over death and the grave. For 40 days
            He walked with his disciples in His new body. Ascending to heaven
            before their eyes with the promise of His return to rule and to
            reign over all the earth. 10 days later He showed the world that He
            is the baptizer in the Holy Spirit and fire .
            <br />
            <br />
            Holy Spirit. He is the Spirit, there from the beginning. He is
            around us in our salvation, but comes in us when we are Baptized in
            the Holy Spirit. He speaks through us in tongues. He guides us in
            all truth and understanding. He is the promised gift of the Father.
            He was sent to us by Jesus. When He speaks to us, it brings glory to
            Jesus. He came to convict the world of sin, unto righteousness, and
            unto judgement. He came to give us power, so that we may be
            witnesses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Salvation. The promise of restoration produced through belief that
            Jesus died for your sins. His blood washes away all your sins.
            Received through faith, not through works. Passed through by
            repentance, showing remorse, and turning from our old ways. A
            journey of killing our flesh, caring our cross like Jesus did.
            Becoming one with His suffering so that we might become one with His
            glory. It is no longer you who live, but Christ that lives in you.
            He is now Lord of your life, submitting daily to His will.
            <br />
            <br />
            Baptism in Water. Immersed fully in the water, becoming one with His
            death, burial, and resurrection. The old man dies, and the new man
            comes to life. A critical deliverance moment for every believer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is tha baptizer of the Holy
            Spirit. Administered through the laying on of hands. Marked by the
            sign of Speaking in Tongues. Given to believers as the source of
            power, enabling us to be an effective witness of the gospel.
