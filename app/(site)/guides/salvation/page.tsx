            1. Introduction & Prayer
          </h1>
          Greet the person and say your name.
          <br />
          We’re going through the neighborhood praying for people.
          <br />
          Is there anything we can pray for you for?
          <br />
          Health? Pain? Family? Job?
          <br />
          How about praying a blessing over you?
          <br />
          Let’s take hands and pray:
          <br />
          [Pray for the request in the NAME OF JESUS. Speak the peace and light
          of JESUS. Bless the person in the NAME OF JESUS. Amen.]
          <h1
            className={
              'mb-3 mt-8 font-serif text-2xl italic leading-tight text-black'
            }
          >
            2. The Million Dollar Question
          </h1>
          Before we go, may we ask you a quick question?
          <br />
          If you had to die today, are you sure that you will go to heaven?
          <br />
          [If "NO", start the story of Jesus.]
          <br />
          If "YES" or “I think so,” ask,
          <br /> Why would God allow you into heaven?
          <br />
          [Common answer: I do good to others]
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s good that you do good to others. That’s how society works and it
          is a blessing to your family. But more than that is needed to go to
          heaven. If doing good is the standard to go to heaven, whose good is
          good enough for God? Even on this street people have different
          standards, some doing better than others. It’s an unequal standard.
          <br />
          <br />
          You see, even when we try to do good, we often fall short. Even while
          we do good, we often think a bad or gossipy thought in our hearts.
          Next thing, a big argument erupts and we say things that we did not
          even know were in us and we do a lot of damage. We hurt the very
          people that we love. The reality is all of us have sinned.

            className={

          >
            3. Heaven Is a Holy Place
          </h1>
          Now, heaven is a holy place and God will not allow anything unclean or
          sinful to enter heaven, or heaven would soon look just like earth. So,
          we have a problem with sin. We need to deal with sin on this side of
          the grave, before we die and stand before God. The Good News is that
          God loves us and has made a way for us.

            4. You’ve Heard About Jesus
          </h1>
          You’ve heard about JESUS, so let’s just focus on Jesus again. Now,
          Jesus was born of Mary, while she was still a virgin. That’s what we
          celebrate around Christmas. Amazing that after 2000 years, His
          birthday is still celebrated around the world! There’s no other person
          like that!
          <br />
          <br />
          Well, He grew up and as a young man He started preaching. He taught
          many truths about God & did many miracles. He was powerful – He even
          opened blind eyes and made the lame to walk.
          <br />
          <br />
          But He also looked deep into the hearts of men. He said difficult
          things like love your enemies; forgive those who mistreat you. These
          things don’t come naturally to us. You see, Jesus looks very deep into
          our hearts.
          <h1
            className={
              'mb-3 mt-8 font-serif text-2xl italic leading-tight text-black'
            }
          >
            5. Jesus Died on the Cross
          </h1>
          You might know too that Jesus died on the cross. How did that happen?
          Well, evil men rose up against Jesus and arrested Him, because they
          were jealous of Him. They took Him to court and called many false
          witnesses against Him, and demanded that the judge hand Him over to be
          crucified. In those days it was how the Roman government executed
          criminals. The cross was to the Romans what the electric chair is to
          America. It was a very brutal death. Hours went by as Jesus hung
          there, tortured to death. Why would such a perfect Man die such a
          brutal death?
          <br />
          <br />
          Jesus did not die for his own sin, for He had no sin. The reason is He
          willingly died for our sin. In fact, the last words that Jesus said on
          the cross were “It is finished”. Now back then, those same words, “It
          is finished” would be written on an account when it was paid in full.
          That’s how they did business back then. So, can you see that Jesus
          paid the full price for our sins, for the penalty of sin is death. He
          died in our place. He shed His blood for you and me, so that we can be
          forgiven of our sins.
          <h1
            className={

            6. Jesus, Buried and Risen
          </h1>
          Not only that, but after He died, they took Him down from the cross
          and put him in a grave. Then on the third day something completely
          surprising happened: Jesus rose from the dead! Can you see that Jesus
          had complete victory over sin, and He had complete victory over death!
          And those are our problems, sin and death: We all sin and we are
          afraid to die. But Jesus had complete victory over sin and He had
          complete victory over death!
          <h1
            className={

            7. Jesus Invites Us
          </h1>
          Jesus said that if we turn from our sin, believe in Him, and receive
          Him into our hearts, we will receive forgiveness of sins and eternal
          life. He will forgive you and wash you clean of all your sin. He will
          make you brand new on the inside. Your heart will be changed & God
          will be inside of you. You will think new thoughts, good thoughts, not
          all the old bad thoughts that you used to have. Have you ever heard of
          being born again? That’s what it is. Jesus will make you brand new on
          the inside. You will be a born again child of God.
          <h1
            className={

            8. Prayer
          </h1>
          Let’s pray together and ask Jesus into your heart. Repeat this after
          me: Father, I come to you in the NAME OF JESUS
          <br />
          I confess that I have sinned many times. I have sinned against you,
          and I have sinned against other people.
          <br />
          [Ask the person to say something specific they need forgiveness of] I
          turn from my sin, LORD JESUS, and I leave it behind.
          <br />
          Forgive me and I forgive those who sinned against me.
          <br />
          LORD JESUS, I believe that you died for my sins on the cross and that
          you rose from the dead. Wash me clean with your blood.
          <br />
          LORD JESUS, come into my heart and make me new. Be the Lord of my life
          and help me to live for you from this day forward. And when I die, I
          will go to heaven and be with you forever.
          <br />
          Thank you JESUS that I am now a child of God. Amen.

          Where is JESUS now?
          <br />
          [In my heart]
          <br />I have good news for you: Your sins are forgiven!
